# Global HIV/AIDS Burden Analysis: Infections, Treatment Access & Mortality Trends

## Problem Statement  
The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to pose a major global public health challenge, with striking disparities in infection rates, access to treatment, and mortality across countries. Although significant progress has been made in expanding treatment and prevention programs, millions of people worldwide remain affected, and outcomes vary greatly by region.

This project seeks to investigate and answer key questions such as:

1. What are the differences in HIV prevalence across countries?

2. What trends are there in antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage?

3. Explore patterns Regional patterns in HIV-related mortality?

4. What gaps do we have in prevention and treatment efforts?

## Objective   
To analyze and visualize HIV data and visualizing , highlight global disparities and trends that can guide better public health decisions.  

## Project Scope  
Dataset used in the project was obtained from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/hiv-aids-dataset  
The dataset comprised of identified HIV infection cases for years 2000, 2010 and 2018  which also included the below listed tables ;  
1. No. of people living with HIV AIDS
2. No. of deaths due to HIV AIDS
3. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission estimates
4. ART (Anti Retro-viral Therapy) coverage among people living with HIV estimates
5. ART (Anti Retro-viral Therapy) coverage among children estimates

### Steps taken are as follows:  
. Data cleaning and transformation    
. A fully designed SQL database  
. Interactive Tableau dashboards  
. Insights on HIV cases, deaths, and ART treatment coverage worldwide

 ## Analysis 
 Analysis was done and story insights presented in Tableau,  
 
 ### Conclusions made were as follows:  
 
Africa still leads in HIV infections, indicating a continued need for increased resources and targeted interventions.  

ART has significantly reduced HIV-related deaths, but countries with high infection rates still record a correspondingly high number of deaths, highlighting gaps in treatment coverage, access, and retention.  

Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) remains a critical strategy, especially since 45% of people living with HIV are women. Strengthening PMTCT programs could greatly reduce transmission.  

### Next Steps...  

Expand the analysis to include other prevention interventions beyond ART. Incorporating data on HIV education, PrEP uptake, condom distribution, and testing coverage will provide a more holistic picture of prevention efforts.  

Use a dataset that includes age groups and new vs. existing infections. This will help identify which age segments are contributing most to new infections and assess the effectiveness of current prevention strategies.  

Explore trends over time to evaluate whether interventions are reducing incidence, improving ART retention, and lowering mortality.

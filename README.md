# HIV-AIDS-DATA-ANALYSIS
## Problem Statement  
The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to pose a major global public health challenge, with striking disparities in infection rates, access to treatment, and mortality across countries. Although significant progress has been made in expanding treatment and prevention programs, millions of people worldwide remain affected, and outcomes vary greatly by region.

This project seeks to investigate and answer key questions such as:

1. What is the current status of HIV/AIDS across the world?

2. Which countries have the highest burden of HIV infections and deaths?

3. Is ART coverage improving over time?

4. How do HIV cases among children compare to adults?

5. Which countries show improvement, and which need urgent intervention?

By analyzing structured HIV data and visualizing it interactively, the project highlights global disparities and trends that can guide better public health decisions.  

## Project Scope  

The project includes:  
. Data cleaning and transformation  
. A fully designed SQL database
. Interactive Tableau dashboards  
. Insights on HIV cases, deaths, and ART treatment coverage worldwide

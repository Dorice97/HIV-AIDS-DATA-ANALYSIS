# Global HIV/AIDS Burden Analysis: Infections, Treatment Access & Mortality Trends

## Problem Statement  
The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to pose a major global public health challenge, with striking disparities in infection rates, access to treatment, and mortality across countries. Although significant progress has been made in expanding treatment and prevention programs, millions of people worldwide remain affected, and outcomes vary greatly by region.

This project seeks to investigate and answer key questions such as:

1. What are the differences in HIV prevalence across countries?

2. What trends are there in antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage?

3. Explore patterns Regional patterns in HIV-related mortality?

4. What gaps do we have in prevention and treatment efforts?

## Objective   
To analyze and visualize HIV data and visualizing , highlight global disparities and trends that can guide better public health decisions.  

## Project Scope  
Dataset used in the project was obtained from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/hiv-aids-dataset  
The dataset comprised of identified HIV infection cases for years 2000, 2010 and 2018  which also included the below listed tables ;  
1. No. of people living with HIV AIDS
2. No. of deaths due to HIV AIDS
3. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission estimates
4. ART (Anti Retro-viral Therapy) coverage among people living with HIV estimates
5. ART (Anti Retro-viral Therapy) coverage among children estimates

### Steps taken are as follows:  
. Data cleaning and transformation    
. A fully designed SQL database  
. Interactive Tableau dashboards  
. Insights on HIV cases, deaths, and ART treatment coverage worldwide
